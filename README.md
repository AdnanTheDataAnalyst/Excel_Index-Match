# Index-Match

The data table presents business-related information, featuring contacts in various departments and regions. Each entry includes details such as the contact's name, department (e.g., Cloud Tech, Strategy, Operations, Big Data), region (Texas, New York, Florida, California), payment method (Transfer, PayPal, Check, Card), revenue, profit, and profit margin. The profit margin is expressed as a percentage, reflecting the profitability of each transaction. I utilized the INDEX and MATCH functions to formulate queries and extract specific information from the dataset. For example, using INDEX and MATCH, one could retrieve the profit value for a particular contact or find the contact with the highest profit margin in a specific region. For more info, data attached.

# Index-Match

The data table presents business-related information, featuring contacts in various departments and regions. Each entry includes details such as the contact's name, department (e.g., Cloud Tech, Strategy, Operations, Big Data), region (Texas, New York, Florida, California), payment method (Transfer, PayPal, Check, Card), revenue, profit, and profit margin. The profit margin is expressed as a percentage, reflecting the profitability of each transaction. I utilized the INDEX and MATCH functions to formulate queries and extract specific information from the dataset. For instance, using INDEX and MATCH, one can easily determine the contact person in Texas by querying the "Contact" column based on the criteria of the "Region" being Texas, resulting in the answer "Bill Smith."
